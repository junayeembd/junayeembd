🚀 Projects
***🚘Traffic Management System**

⛳Technology: C Language

 🗺️Course: CSE100

🚨Description:

This C-based Traffic Management System handles user and admin functionalities using file handling for data storage. The system includes:

👤👤User Panel: Users can register, view, and add car and license details. They can view traffic rules and violations but cannot edit or delete data.

👤Admin Panel: Admin has full control to manage users, cars, licenses, violations, traffic rules, and generate reports.

⛳Features:

-Login/Registration: Secure user authentication.

-Car & License Management: Users add car details (model, number plate, etc.) and licenses (issue & expiry dates).

-Data Validation: Ensures no duplicate registrations, proper date formats, and checks expiry dates.

-Violation & Fines: Admin can mark fines as paid/unpaid.

-Notifications: Alerts users when licenses are about to expire.

-Reports & Search: Admin can generate reports and search through records based on multiple parameters.

🧷Files:

***📝Main.c, user.c, car.c, license.c, violation.c, traffic_rules.c, admin.c, utils.c, header.h
